#run_analysis.R Code Book
This file describes the tidy dataset of 180 observations and 88 variables yielded by run_analysis.R and the process to produce it.    

***

#Data

***

This file includes some of the data obtained from an experiment carried out at the University of Genoa with a group of people within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each subject performed six activities(WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS  LAYING, SITTING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). Initially, a paper was published with the results from this experiment in a form of a dataset with the observations on 561 features. A summary of these features is displayed here, with its  average for each subject and each activity.

#Process 

***

1.Merge by pair using rbind() :

    **X_test.txt** and **X_train.txt** (test and training sets)--(merged dataset)

    **y_test.txt** and **y_train.txt** (test and training labels)--(labels dataset)

    **subject_test.txt** and **subject_train.txt** (test and training subjects)--(subject dataset)


2.Obtain a vector which contains the position (column number) of each of the mean and standard deviation measurement, using the regular expressions in "features.txt"


3.Subset the columns on mean and standard deviation in the merged dataset using the last vector 


4.Add the columns with the subjects and activity to the merged dataset


5.Name the activities appropriately


6.Get the names of the features (measure variables) in "features.txt" 


7.Correct the names of the features


8.Label the data set with appropriately variable names


9.Create an independent data set with the average of the variables for each subject for each activity
